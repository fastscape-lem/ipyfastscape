# ipyfastscape

Interactive widgets for topographic data analysis and modelling in Jupyter notebooks.

While ipyfastscape is tightly integrated with [fastscape](https://github.com/fastscape-lem/fastscape),
it also integrates very well with any data in the form of an [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray)
dataset or any model created with [xarray-simlab](https://github.com/benbovy/xarray-simlab).
